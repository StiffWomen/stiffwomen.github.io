### Florence Nightingale

Florence Nightingale, named after her city of birth, opens the collection of statues simply because throughout her life she was a woman of undeniable firsts. Nightingale's story is fascinating and fascinatingly undertold as most will think of her only as "the lady with the lamp" who cared for soldiers wounded in the Crimean War. This is also how London decided to remember her when she was cast in bronze in 1914. A hundred years later, let's revamp the memory of what she shone light on!

<b>Doing her own thing.</b> Florence's family background is fairly well known as an upper middle class woman who insisted on becoming a nurse rather than marrying, a pursuit her family eventually agreed to (likely after realising it was becoming to late to make her into a proper woman). After training and working her way up the hospital hierarchy she ended up in conversation with Sidney Herbert, the Secretary of State at War, who now stands next to Florence in the war memorial near Trafalgar square in London.

<b>1854, first women in the army.</b> Sidney Herbert agreed to let Nightingale pick 38 nurses that she could bring to work in a war hospital in Turkey where soldiers who had been wounded in the Crimean War were brought to mostly not recover. This group became the first women to officially serve in the army and they started their work by cleaning a hospital that had a ground floor "covered with filth [code word for faeces] in consequence". Death tolls were appalling and rising despite the work of Nightingale's team, until the Sanitary Commission came in 1955 to flush out the sewers and undertake renovations.

<b>Data wizz of the 1800s, and another first...</b> Florence became a star during the few years she spent at the hospital, where she became a symbol of charity and caring to the point where her image was printed on bags and souvenirs and she attracted the support of the British royal family. But a lot of her work and contribution started after the war, when she endeavoured to show beyond doubt that sanitation reform makes all the difference in war hospitals. Going through military records together with statisticians William Farr and John Sutherland, she came to the almost unbelievable conclusion that 16,000 out of 18,000 military deaths were due to preventable disease, not battle wounds. To make her point clearly, she visualised the numbers in a 'rose diagram' or a polar area chart that showed a drop in death rates by 99% in a single year after the sanitation reforms. Her work as the Hans Rosling of the 1800s got her accepted as the first female fellow of the in the Royal Statistical Society.

And then to round it off, before she died she became the first woman to receive the Order of Merit.

Pretty badass. You can find Florence at Waterloo Place, London.
