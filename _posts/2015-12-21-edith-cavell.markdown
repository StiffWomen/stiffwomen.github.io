### Edith Cavell

Just over 100 years ago, on October 12th 1915, Edith Cavell was brought out to face a firing squad of German soldiers together with Belgian architect Philippe Baucq. Cavell was a British nurse who travelled to Belgium as the war broke out, intending to use her nursing skills to help soldiers fighting at the front. Although Cavell aided soldiers fighting on both sides of the war, she soon became involved in the resistance movement to help allied troops cross the border.

After her arrest, Cavell admitted to having helped over 200 allied soldiers into the neutral Netherlands.
