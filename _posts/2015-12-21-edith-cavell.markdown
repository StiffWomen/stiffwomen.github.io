Although the world wars are often promoted as having provided an important opportunity for women to step outside the households and gain entry into working life - thus paving the way for standing on more equal footing with men - women's role in the world wars are more like extras in a movie - there, but not quite.

They are the things that they have lived in - not themselves, symbols of every women - not individuals. There, but not quite.

There are however two important women from the war in London. Edith Cavell and Noor Nayat Khan. 

### Edith Cavell

Just over 100 years ago, on October 12th 1915, Edith Cavell was brought out to face a firing squad of German soldiers together with Belgian architect Philippe Baucq. Cavell was a British nurse who travelled to Belgium as the war broke out, intending to use her nursing skills to help soldiers fighting at the front. Although Cavell aided soldiers fighting on both sides of the war, she soon became involved in the resistance movement to help allied troops cross the border.

After her arrest, Cavell admitted to having helped over 200 allied soldiers into the neutral Netherlands.
