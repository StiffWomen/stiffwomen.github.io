Although the world wars are often emphasised as an important part of the struggle for female emancipation in Europe - having provided an opportunity for women to step outside the households and gain entry into working life - women's actual roles in the world wars are perceived more like extras in a movie: we know they are there but we couldn't for the life of our grandma identify one of them.

This perception is strengthened by public remembrance of women in the war - the female war memorial in London is dedicated to all the women of the war collectively. It shows no sign that female workers who contributed to the war effort were individual human beings but rather depicts their empty, left-behind jackets next to each other. The idea that a memorial would commemorate all women, equally and without forgetting anyone, is compelling but becomes problematic when across the road we have no complexes about depicting rows of men for their individual contributions.

Nevertheless, there are a few examples of women of the war who have gained a permanent place in the public space for their contributions. Let's bring them a bit closer to the light.

### Edith Cavell

-- Enter pic of Edith Cavell --

Just over 100 years ago, on October 12th 1915, Edith Cavell was brought out to face a firing squad of German soldiers together with Belgian architect Philippe Baucq. Cavell was a British nurse who travelled to Belgium as the war broke out, intending to use her nursing skills to help soldiers fighting at the front. Although Cavell aided soldiers fighting on both sides of the war, she soon became involved in the resistance movement to help allied troops cross the border.

After her arrest, Cavell admitted to having helped over 200 allied soldiers into the neutral Netherlands but this wasn't the story told by British authorities after her execution. Cavell's story was rewritten to portray a selfless nurse who had been cruelly murdered by the Germans - great story for rallying new soldiers to war! Like [link!] Nightingale [/!link], the memory of Cavell was reworked to the benefit of  

In fact, for the centenary of her death, the British MIA admitted that there was evidence that Cavell has been an active part of the resistance - from passitivity to bad ass activist.

### Gabrielle Petit

In Brussels we find a third activist woman with a statue, Gabrielle Petit, leader of the resistance who is famously said to have set out to prove how Belgians die.


There were certainly more women who made significant contributions during wars now approaching their centenary anniversaries - who else should be remembered and who has had their memory tweaked and used for other purposes.
